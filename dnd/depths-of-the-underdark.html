  <h3>Exploration into the Lost Underground World</h3>
  <p>Your story begins when the regional head of an established mining operation hires a group of adventurers and asks them to meet in an ancient dwarven fortress. The operation has been using the abandoned dwarven mines as a starting point for their own mining operation, but the veins have all run dry. There is a dwarven holy site further down, and it is known that there are more tunnels past it, but after the mining operation started a group of dwarfs occupied the site, intent on keeping the miners out. The mining company has hired you to negotiate regular passage through the holy site, or remove the dwarves from it if negotiations fail. Once you have done that, you are to scout out the tunnels beyond the site and find a suitable site for initial mining operations in the new area, and report them back to the mining team when they reach the holy site.</p>
  <br>
  <p>That is the beginning of your adventure, anyways. While the world above believes that the dwarves are now minuscule, fractured people, whose civilization like many others was broken when they fled into the depths from the rising tide of humanity, who really knows really lies in the dark.</p>

  <h4>Known Lore and History of the World</h4>
  <p>This is information about the world as known by the peoples who live on the surface. It is the tale of a victorious empire, whose power slowly forced the other cultures and nations into either submission, or into the mysterious tunnels leading underground. While there is a history to the underdark realms, it is not known to the people who live above. They only know that the groups who fled underground were scarcely seen or heard from again. It is for you to discover.

        <div class="panel-body">The Dwarves were in the mountainous central region of the island for hundreds of years, building massive cities into the valleys and deep tunnels into the ground. With the rise of humanity, however, their nations slowly began to decline. They lost access to the sea. They lost their long established trade with other kingdoms and nations. It is said they finally lost their people to famine, disease, and finally internal strife. The last great King of the Dwarves died fighting on the walls of the valley-city of Ulo, as the Human Empire fought to pacify the last holdout of independent rule on the continent. But what they found was an empty city. Neither the living, nor the dead, were present.</div>
      </div>
      <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">Having taken the last refuge of the Dwarves, the imperial soldiers sacked the city, and sought out the great tunnels from which the Dwarves both obtained and secured their wealth. Most were collapsed under rock and rubble, and those that weren't were buried were filled with deadly traps for the unprepared. A rare few contained holdouts of dwarves, who fought until their tunnels too collapsed, crushing both them and the invaders. With the city occupied, the remaining tunnels had their traps dismantled, and expedition parties sent into them. As they traveled, they found mines stripped bare and empty. They found entire underground cities and castles, all ruined and abandoned, with only whispers and shadows within them.The tunnels seemed to go forever. But at a certain point the search parties no longer returned, and the expeditions were halted, without knowing quite what lay at the end. </div>

      <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">The so called Final Empire was established by the human dominated kingdoms of the north. A growing population and a rising sense of human unity led to the formation of a strong federation, capable of fielding large armies. At the same time, species specific plagues decimated the older races to the south, leaving them weak and exposed to external invasion. Under the leadership of a new imperial dynasty, the federal empire struck south, taking control of the foreign states and establishing a hegemony over them. Human colonists slowly pushed south, causing a mass migration of many species to old strongholds for a final stand. The last of these was the Dwarves in Ulo, whose fall lead to the establishment of the Final Empire.  </div>

      <div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">The city of Ulo was always occupied, even if no one lived there. When reports of the shadowy figures were reported near the tunnel entrances, the occupation forces were increased by imperial decree, but nothing ever emerged. Over time the city and its dwindling garrison were nearly forgotten, and the region became overrun with human bandits, until the great Mining Conglomeration decided that it would be cheaper to use the old Dwarven mines instead of creating their own. They bought the city from a nearly insolvent imperial government, and occupied it heavily to protect their interests. The mines were not what they had read about though. Old monsters, long thought vanquished, lay in wait like predators in the dark. The abandoned underground cities contained small tribes of mixed race origin, who would attack small groups and fade away in the face of overwhelming force. And while those large, coordinated forces would never simply disappear, they always seemed to be blocked at every turn.</div>
